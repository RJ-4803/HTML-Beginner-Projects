- Submit button
- Optional “remember me” checkbox
- Clear structure for later backend integration

## Explanation
This login page includes:

- A `<form>` with input fields for username and password  
- Required validation for both inputs  
- A checkbox for “Remember me”  
- Basic styling to make it user-friendly and ready for backend integration

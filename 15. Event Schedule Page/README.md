# Event Schedule Page

## Description
An event schedule page displays the agenda or timeline of an event. This project helps you practice creating structured layouts using HTML tables or lists.

## Features
- Event name and date
- List or table of sessions, talks, or workshops
- Time, title, and speaker (if any) for each session

## Explanation
This page uses:

- A `<table>` with headers and rows to clearly show session details  
- `<thead>` and `<tbody>` for better table semantics  
- Simple layout that can be styled into a full agenda or printed program

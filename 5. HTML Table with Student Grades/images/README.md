# HTML Table with Student Grades

## Description
This project helps you learn how to structure tabular data using HTML `<table>` elements. You’ll build a simple student grades report with rows and columns.

## Features
- Table header row
- Student names and subjects
- Grades for each student
- Basic table layout using `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>`

## Explanation
This project introduces the basic HTML table structure:

- `<table>` creates the table  
- `<thead>` contains the header row with `<th>` cells  
- `<tbody>` contains the data rows with `<td>` cells  
- `border`, `cellpadding`, and `cellspacing` add basic styling without CSS  

Later, you can enhance it with CSS for cleaner visuals or interactivity.

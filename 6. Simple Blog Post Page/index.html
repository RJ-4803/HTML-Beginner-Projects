                <p>Like many beginners, I was always fascinated by how websites work. In 2025, I finally decided to dive
                into the world of web development and start building things on my own.</p>
                <P>I began with HTML, the basic structure of the web. It was exciting to see how simple tags could create
                headings, paragraphs, images, and links.</P>
                <p>This is just the beginning of my journey, and I’m looking forward to sharing what I learn along the way!</p>
